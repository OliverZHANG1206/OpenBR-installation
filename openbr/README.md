#### I have changed the "qt5_use_module()" to "target_link_libraries()", as the Qt version is higher than 5.10 would have warnings occurs when doing CMake configuration.
    The CMakeList.txt I have changed is in /openbr; /app/br; /app/br-gui; /app/examples;
#### I have changed the CMake verison up to 2.8.12 as the CMake will no looger support "CMP0020 OLD" and "CMP0022 OLD"
