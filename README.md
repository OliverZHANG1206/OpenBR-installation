## OpenBR-installation for OpenCV4.X above
### This package could install the OpenBR on VS2019 platform with OpenCV version is 4.X above. I have modified the CMakeLists.txt in the orginal Openbr folder.

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;1. Download Visual Studio 2019, Qt (5.12.2), CMake (minimum required: 2.8.12) and OpenCV4.X.
##### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: The Qt should download with "msvc2019_64" coponents at corresponding version
##### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Download](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/zh-hans/vs/) for VS2019; [Download](https://www.qt.io/download) for Qt; [Download](https://cmake.org/download/) for CMake; [Download](https://opencv.org/releases/) for OpenCV
